Web development
---------------

I have wanted to learn to code for a long time, as I believe web apps can add much value to organisations.  Once I found out that I could learn to code in an intensive environment I seized this opportunity.  Over the past three months I have definitely enjoyed learning to code and I look forward to creating beautiful web apps in the future.
